## Project Overview

This repository contains a fully documented design of a 4-inch flanged steel pipe 90-degree elbow, including:

- SolidWorks 2D drawing & 3D part file
- 3D part file in STEP, IGES, and STL open-source formats
- Complete GD&T annotations
- Hand calculations for hoop stress and allowable internal pressure
- Application of ASME B31.3 design principles and wall thickness rules
- Designed for bolted installation with gasket groove and countersunk flanges

---

## Design Specs

- Pipe ID | 4.000 in
- Wall thickness	| 0.500 in
- Bend radius	| 7.000 in (inner surface)
- Max internal pressure	| 5.000 ksi (FoS = 1.5)
- Material | ASTM A106 Grade B

---

## Included Files

- Pipe_2D_Drawing.pdf | Fully dimensioned and toleranced drawing
- Pipe_Hand_Calcs.pdf | Pressure validation and stress analysis
- Combined_PDF.pdf | Drawing & hand calcs in one document (for reviewers/employers)

---

## Purpose

This project was created to demonstrate proficiency in:

- Engineering design for manufacturability (DFM)
- Mechanical drawing and dimensioning (ASME Y14.5)
- Stress verification and classical mechanics
- Communicating design intent clearly and professionally

## Notes

- All work uploaded to this repository is **original, self-authored work provided for demonstration purposes.
- No proprietary or employer-derived material is included.
- The SolidWorks license used to generate the SLDPRT/SLDDRW native file formats was the 3DXPERIENCE Maker Edition. Commercial SolidWorks users must use DraftSight or a similar viewing software to view the SLDPRT/SLDDRW native file formats
