## Project Overview

This repository contains a fully documented design of a 4" ID, flange bolt fastened, 90Â° steel pipe elbow:  

![preview](docs/Pipe_Preview.png)  

The design includes:  

- SolidWorks 2D drawing & 3D part file
- 3D part file in STEP, IGES, and STL open-source formats
- Complete GD&T annotations
- Hand calculations for hoop stress and allowable internal pressure
- Application of ASME B31.3 design principles and wall thickness rules
- Designed for bolted installation with semicircular gasket groove and countersunk flanges
