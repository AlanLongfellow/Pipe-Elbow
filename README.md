## Project Overview

This repository contains a fully documented design of a 4-inch flanged steel pipe 90-degree elbow:  

![preview](docs/pipe_drawing_preview.png)  

The design includes:  

- SolidWorks 2D drawing & 3D part file
- 3D part file in STEP, IGES, and STL open-source formats
- Complete GD&T annotations
- Hand calculations for hoop stress and allowable internal pressure
- Application of ASME B31.3 design principles and wall thickness rules
- Designed for bolted installation with semicircular gasket groove and countersunk flanges

## Purpose

This project was created to demonstrate proficiency in:

- Engineering design for manufacturability (DFM)
- Mechanical drawing and dimensioning (ASME Y14.5)
- Stress verification and classical mechanics
- Communicating design intent clearly and professionally

## Notes

- All work uploaded to this repository is original, self-authored work provided for demonstration purposes.
- No proprietary or employer-derived material is included.
- The SolidWorks license used to generate the SLDPRT/SLDDRW native file formats was the 3DXPERIENCE Maker Edition. Commercial SolidWorks users must use DraftSight or a similar viewing software to view the SLDPRT/SLDDRW native file formats
